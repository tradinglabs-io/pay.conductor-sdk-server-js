#PayConductor API

#PayConductor API Documentation.  This documentation covers all available features in the PayConductor RESTful API, including authentication, resource management, and usage examples.  <br />  <br />  ----  <br />   # Authentication  PayConductor API uses HTTP Basic authentication to validate requests. You need to provide your credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) in the `client:secret` format encoded in Base64.  <br />  ## Getting Credentials  1. Access the PayConductor admin panel 2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys** 3. Generate a new credentials pair (Client ID and Client Secret) 4. Store the Client Secret in a secure location - it will not be displayed again  <br />  ## Authentication Format  Credentials must be sent in the `Authorization` header using the Basic scheme:  ``` Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret) ```  <br />  ## Node.js Example  ```javascript const clientId = 'your_client_id'; const clientSecret = 'your_client_secret';  // Encode credentials in Base64 const credentials = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64');  const response = await fetch('https://api.payconductor.com/api/v1/orders', {   method: 'GET',   headers: {     'Authorization': `Basic ${credentials}`,     'Content-Type': 'application/json'   } });  const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); ```  <br />  ## Authentication Errors  | Code | Description | |------|-------------| | `401` | Invalid or missing credentials | | `403` | Valid credentials but no permission for the resource | | `429` | Too many requests (rate limit exceeded) |  ### Error Response Example  ```json {   \"error\": {     \"code\": \"UNAUTHORIZED\",     \"message\": \"Invalid credentials\",     \"details\": \"The provided client ID or secret is incorrect\"   } } ```

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.

    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
